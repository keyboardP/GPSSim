IF you have trouble getting the code to run, please email me (phone7@live.co.uk) or comment on my blog post:
http://phone7.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/no-device-no-gps-no-matter-with-code/

-You will have to change "Form1.cs" Line 71 - Change that path to your map.html file.
-Run the service (winform) before your WP7 application
-Full error handling is not included and the code is only for development - it's not necessarily best practise or optimal

If you found this useful, feel free to let me know. You can contact  me above or on Twitter (@keyboardP)

Thanks and enjoy!
